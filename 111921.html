<em>Avoiding Rerendering &#8211 Friday,
    Nov. 19, 2021</em>

<body>
    <p>
        By nature, react components rerender automatically whenever a change occurs in its state or props. However,
        unnecessary rerenders of components can slow down performance, which is always no bueno. To learn how to avoid
        this inefficiency, I turned to <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/blog/react-rerenders">this tutorial</a> by
        DebugBear. The idea is to only update components when needed, rather than automatically, and also to avoid
        unintentional rerenders.

        One issue is that whenever a parent component rerenders, its children components rerender, too. To avoid this,
        the <code>React.memo</code> component can be used. According to the <a
            href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo"> React documentation</a>, <code>React.memo</code>
        is a higher order component that memoizes results of a call, meaning that rather than rerendering a component,
        the last rendered result is used instead. In short, <code>React.memo</code> only rerenders when props change. So
        if we have a <code>Counter</code> component, we would say:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
const Counter = React.memo(function Counter({ name, value }) {
    console.log(`Rendering counter ${name}`);
    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            {name}: {value}
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
});
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        So that if we had multiple counters, only the one whose value has changed would be rerendered. Preventing
        rerendering becomes a little more complicated when props like <code>onClickIncrement</code> are passed, however;
        the prop changes from every rerender. To solve this, we can use a <code>useCallback</code> hook instead to
        memoize. This is what that would look like:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
&lt;Counter
    name="A"
    value={counterA}
    onClickIncrement={React.useCallback(() =&gt; setCounterA(counterA + 1), [counterA])}
/&gt;
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        So now when counter A changes value, it is the only counter to rerender. This approach tackles the issue of
        unintentional prop changes triggering component rerenders. Another issue occurs with passing object literals as
        props, because every time <code>App</code> renders, a new object must be created. A quick solution to this is,
        when applicable, simply creating the object once outside of the <code>App</code> component. This works in the
        case that the object stays the same, like a header. For dynamic objects, we can once again use a
        <code>useMemo</code> hook. In this case, the header component would only rerender if, say, the font was changed,
        rather than every time a counter changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, it seems like there's a lot of room for inefficiency-- this blog barely scracthed the surface of
        possible rerendering scenarios. There's probably a fine line between excessive optimization and functionally
        working code. There's a lot more to investigate and understand about rerendering, but tomorrow is Thanksgiving
        break and my brain is <i>rendered</i> useless right now.
