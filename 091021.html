<em>Templates & SEO &#8211 Friday,
    Sep. 10, 2021</em>
<p>After a quick Google
    search of
    "How to write better HTML", the <a
        href="https://msandrini.medium.com/how-to-write-html-in-2021-b94196f4e165">article I found</a> basically advised
    front-end web developers to avoid falling into the routine of
    &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;, and rather to make use of the templates offered by HTML. Two benefits of doing so
    included "Search Engine Optimisation, of course" and that "Template structures are more identifiable and
    therefore more readable."<br><br>Search Engine Optimization? Of course! Wait... what's Search Engine Optimization
    (SEO)? According to <a href=https://html.com/seo>HTML documentation</a>, it refers to the process by which
    developers make a website appear higher up in results from a search engine. Working on the SEO improves a website's
    traffic, as more users tend to click on the first few search results they see. As Google is the most popular search
    engine, a website optimized for Google will perform well, allowing for more search traffic.<br><br>For example,
    Google's search algorithm favors mobile-friendly websotes over those that are not. The more portable your website
    is, the more traffic you may get!</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of search
    engines like Google is to return results that are relevant, accessible, and high-quality. SEO can be achieved in a
    variety of ways. A couple of these are by implementing Google Analytic tools&#8211which track site metrics&#8211and
    by having <i>other</i> websites backlink your own, thus growing your credibility. But I wanted to focus on the
    HTML-specific qualities of SEO.<br><br>For example, the &lt;meta&gt; tag is used to define metadata about key
    concepts of an
    HTML document. Though this metadata does not appear on the screen, it is used by browsers, search engines, and other
    webservices to indicate the content of your webpage. Consider the following code:<br><br>
<pre>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;meta name="description" content="Week 2 blogpost"&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;meta name="keywords" content="HTML, SEO, web traffic"&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;meta name="author" content="Chelsea Le Sage"&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;</pre>
</p>
<p>The <code>charset</code>
    attribute indicates which character encoding is used for
    the document. Meanwhile, the <code>name</code> attribute can indicate a few values, like an author, description, or
    key words
    for the document. Including these tags contribute to SEO!<br><br>So now, using that code for metadata we can follow
    a typical HTML template, because recall that templates improve readability:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>
&emsp;&lt;html&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&lt;title&gt;Web Dev Blog&lt;/title&gt;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&lt;meta name="description" content="Week 2 blogpost"&gt;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&lt;meta name="keywords" content="HTML, SEO, web traffic"&gt;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&lt;meta name="author" content="Chelsea Le Sage"&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
    &emsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Here's some blog content!<br>
    &emsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&emsp;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>This template structure is
    important because &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are not <i>semantic</i> HTML
    elements, meaning that they do not tell the computer anything about their content; they are too general purpose. But
    keep in mind that semantic tags, however, do not offer any style specifications. So with semantic tags providing us
    document structure, meta tags specifically supplying metadata to search engines, and with a mobile-portable website,
    traffic should start flowing! Just make sure not to let the fame get to your head.</p>
