<em style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; color: #7e7e7e; font-size: small;">The Inspect Tool &#8211 Friday,
    Sep. 3, 2021</em>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #727171; font-size: 1.2rem;">During development, us
    programmers have to
    put on our investigator hats; or rather, today we'll be wearing our
    <i>inspect</i>-igator hat. Sure, Chrome provides <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/">official
        documentation</a> that gives clear step-by-step instructions for using their DevTools and Inspect feature, but
    why would you read
    that when you can listen to me, someone with a brand-new domain name and a week-and-a-half of web development under
    their belt?<br><br>We'll be focusing specifically on the <i>Chrome</i> Inspect tool because that is the browser I
    prefer
    to use. It's a feature I learned to use long before ever studying computer science&#8211 in middle school, we used
    it to change the text on the official county website for various, devious reasons. But nowadays I use it to find
    color values, certain font names, and understand web layouts, no longer to convince my mom that it <i>actually
        is</i> a snow day.<br><br>My go-to way to access this feature is to right click while on a web page and select
    "Inspect" from the drop-down, which opens the
    Chrome DevTools panel. Then click the Inspect icon:

        height="50%">
    <img src="https://developer-chrome-com.imgix.net/image/BrQidfK9jaQyIHwdw91aVpkPiib2/2canqdvrgnHBayY1VsLM.png?auto=format&w=1600"
        height="50%" style="margin-top: 6px;">
</div>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #727171; font-size: 1.2rem;"> Now, clicking on an element
    will show us where in
    the Document Object Model (<a href="https://javascript.info/dom-nodes">DOM</a>) tree that object occurs.
    Essentially, this DOM tree outlines the logical structure of our HTML, with its 'cascading' format. HTML tags are
    treated as objects, and anything nested within a tag is its child. This makes things simple for pinpointing specific
    webpage elements. For example, I visited <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/">twodee.org</a>
    and felt quite inspired. I inspected the text beneath the postTitle (CS 347: Lab 3 &#8211 More HTML) and found a tag
    I've never seen before, the &lt;em&gt; tag. This is a tag for emphasized text. Well, that doesn't seem too crazy,
    because we can use &lt;i&gt; to italicize the text and get the same thing right? <em>Wrong!</em>
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="L1-em.jpg" height="50%"
        style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">
    <img src="L1-color.jpg" height="50%"
        style="margin-left: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">

</div>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #727171; font-size: 1.2rem;">
    <br>The &lt;em&gt; tag is especially cool because with the use of a screen reader, any words within the tab will be
    verbally stressed. This way, we can make our message more accessible to any user that is visually imapaired and
    relies on assistence. Here, I use &lt;em&gt; underneath the page title to describe what the blog post is about as
    well as the date: <code style="color: #727171; background-color: #e9e9e9;">&lt;em style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; color: #7e7e7e; font-size: small;"&gt;The Inspect Tool &#8211 Friday,
        Sep. 3, 2021&lt;/em&gt;</code><br><br>Another cool accessibility feature is how DevTools will indicate whether
    or not the color contrast is large
    enough. Essentially, this helps users with color blindess or poor eyesight, as a higher contrast between text and
    its background makes it easier to read. In the screenshot above, I pulled the red/salmon color from the
    aforementioned postTitle. The checkmark next to the 3.71 indicates that DevTools approves of color
    balance.<br><br>One more feature of the Chrome DevTools I want to touch on is the ability to make stylistic changes
    without having
    to update the actual code; if I want to experiment with different colors for my text or backgrounds, I can change
    the values within the DevTools <i>Styles</i> tab and see it change without needing to save and compile code. I
    didn't know that until now! Though I can wrap my brain better around the UI-adjacent features of DevTools, the
    documentation after the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/">DOM section</a> dives into network
    activity, cookies storage, and debugging &#8211 all extremely helpful devices for when your blog traffic is more
    than one person a week. Who knows, maybe I'll write a post about that in the future.<br><br>Until then, DOM-inate
    the rest of your day!
