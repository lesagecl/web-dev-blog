<em>React-Redux Hooks &#8211 Friday,
    Nov. 12, 2021</em>

<body>
    <p>
        Yarr, behold, matey! We be learnin' about hooks today. Specficially, <a
            href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks">React Redux hooks</a>. To begin, what is a hook? Simply put,
        they are functions that allow us to use state and other React features without explicitely having to write a
        class; with them we have access to a function's lifecyle features and components. So rather than having to
        switch between different components and classes, and render their props, we can use a hook instead. The list of
        React Redux hook APIs includes:
    </p>
    <ul class="description">
        <li><code>useSelector()</code>- retrieve data from a store state via a use function</li>
        <li><code>useDispatch()</code>- for dispatching actions</li>
        <li><code>useStore()</code>- get the store that was passed as reference to the Provider</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we can explore the question of how hooks work. Here's a high-level overview of the hook mechanism:</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <!-- <img src="https://i.fbcd.co/products/resized/resized-1500-1000/952792e8ae8090fd95ace68fbede6ade4f4bb7c6187008b3ca6a3117949b7dc9.webp"

            class="blogimg">
    </div>
    <p>The main three pieces we see here are for storing the state, getting the state, and then changing the state.
        These relate to the store, getState() method, and the action and reducer methods, respectively. Foremost, the
        dispatcher is the object that contains our hook functions, and the provider is what helps us save the state of
        the store. </p>
    <p>To begin implementing hooks, we need to start with making the store accessible throughout the component:</p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
const store = createStore(rootReducer)

ReactDOM.render(
    &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;
        &lt;App /&gt;
    &lt;/Provider&gt;,
    document.getElementById('root')
)
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Then, say we want to created a todo list and render those text items into our app. For this we would use props
        within a useSelector to assign the todo items:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
            
export const TodoItem = (props) => {
    const todo = useSelector((state) => state.todoItems[props.id])
    return &lt;div&gt;{todo.text}&lt;/div&gt;
}            
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        So thus the selector only depends on the state. When this is the case, we just need to make sure to declare this
        selector outside of the component, which ensures that the same instance of the selector is used for each
        app render. With useDispatch, we can dispatch any item we want to the store. This is done by adding an action as
        an argument. Full disclosure, I'm not sure if this works in this exact scenario, but it would look something
        like
        this:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
            
export const TodoItem = (props) => {
    const todo = useSelector((state) => state.todoItems[props.id])
    const dispatch = useDispatch()

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;{todo.text}&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;{dispatch({type: "SET_TODO", paylod: "Buy milk"})}&lt;/button&gt;
    )
}            
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>Lastly, useSelector() usually takes the place of useStore(). There can be times when the store needs to be
        accessed, but for the most part, useSelector() gets the job done.</p>
