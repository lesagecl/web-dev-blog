<em>onClick Event Handling &#8211 Friday,
    Dec. 3, 2021</em>

<body>
    <p>For this blog I referenced the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html">React documentation</a>
        and <a
            href="https://upmostly.com/tutorials/react-onclick-event-handling-with-examples#update-state-in-onclick-event-handler">this
            tutorial</a> to learn more about onClick event handling. This seems like a good area to research because I
        will need to implement multiple onClick events for my project. An onCLick event handler is more versatile than
        just triggering a function when a button is clicked. For example, we can also use onClick to call multiple
        functions, change the state, or pass values. This blog will be going over the uses of some of these cases as
        well as provide code examples for these scenarios.
    </p>

        The first application we'll cover is calling multiple functions in an onClick call. There are two approaches we
        can take to achieve this. The first is executing a code block within the onClick handler. The second option is
        simply to call multiple functions within the onClick. Let's say we have this button:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
&lt;button onClick={() =&gt; {
    this.greeting()
    this.setState({name: 'Jimi'});
}}>
    Click here for a greeting
&lt;/button&gt;
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>This illustrates the option of calling multiple functions within the onClick handler. Of course, we could always
        just set the state within the greeting function as well, but you get the point; we're able to call multiple
        functions with a singular onClick event. We can follow this similar formula to update a component's state via an
        onClick event. For this scenario, we'll be updating the state with the button's value each time it's clicked,
        but other values, like those from loops, can be used as well.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
return(
    &lt;button onClick={() => setCount(5)}&gt;
        Set Value
    &lt;/button&gt;
);
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Lastly, we can also pass values from our button as an argument to a function. This is pretty similar to
        onChange.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
return(
    &lt;button value="PANIC" onClick={e => alert(e.target.value)}&gt;
        Panic Button
    &lt;/button&gt;
);
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Not the most useful button, but it does illustrate how the value can be pulled directly fromn the button and
        passed through as a function argument. According to the React documentation, <i>e</i> is considered a
        <i>synthetic event</i>, which isn't exactly a native event, but does contain useful data about the event, like
        in this case, the target value. <i>e.target.value</i> is the value we define for the button, "PANIC". To
        my understanding, any UI component with an onClick event handler is considered a button, not only those
        explicitly stated as a &lt;button&gt;. Still, there's a lot more to events than this. We can also concern
        ourselves with binding, but that's kind of scary. Regardless, event handlers like onClick are at the core of
        React; after all, it's how users actually interact with the app.
