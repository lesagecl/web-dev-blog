        Well, this is it! An entire semester passed in a blink of an eye. Looking back, I've learned a lot more than I
        had previously realized. It's surprising to see how many lab files my desktop has accumulated over these past
        few months. I'm definitely more confident in my backend capabilities and have learned some pretty nifty html/css
        tricks. If only we had the time to help out those websites we looked at the first day of class!
    </p>
    <p>
        This class has also proven that growth comes from feedback, so let's get down to the nitty gritty about how this
        course could be improved.

        Firstly, I miss Canvas. I've never had a professor <i>not</i> use Canvas before, so it was a little jarring. The
        weekly emails are nice, but I really wish that crowdsource allowed us to look at our previous submissions.
        Sometimes my partner would have all the lab files and I would later wish I had them, too. Eventually I learned
        to download the files during the liveshare session, but having an assignment on canvas where we can submit and
        view our submission would be nice (because I get paranoid about that type of thing and always recheck my
        assignments).
    </p>

        Second, while I did appreciate lab days and the collaborative class environment, I do wish we had some lectures
        when it came to learning endpoints and React. I'm not saying lectures every week, but sprinkled here and there.
        Or even just reserving time at the end of class to go over the lab solution would have been much appreciated.
        Personally, I found the styling portion of the course easy to learn quickly, but struggled with the latter two
        topics and wished we spent more time on them, and definitely would have liked designated class time where you
        went over key points.
    </p>
    <p>
        The textbook was a life saver when it came to front-end and endpoints. As for react, I had some difficulty
        following the textbook examples on my own; I often wished there was some repo I could look at just to see what
        code goes where, like for Dukebox and other labs my partner and I never got close to finishing-- and speaking of
        not
        finishing labs, this became frustrating when labs built on one another and we were graded on completion. Though
        this only happened a couple times, getting no credit for attempting the lab was a little discouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though having solo projects did save us from the nonsense of figuring out how to deploy our website on two
        different droplets, I think for my sanity I would have benefit from having a partner for the last two projects.
        As of writing this blog, I still havent finished project 3 and I've been putting in anywhere from three to seven
        hours of work on it a day for the past two-ish weeks, and having a partner might make me feel less alone in my
        struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all though, I would take this course again or recommend it to a friend. Thanks for the great semester!
    </p>
