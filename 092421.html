<em>Bootstrap &#8211 Friday,
    Sep. 24, 2021</em>
<p>What is Bootstrap? Well, it's not just a strap at the back of a pair of boots. Bootstrap is a UI framework that takes
    a mobile-first web development approach (hey, remember that from the last blog post?). So let's begin to understand
    how
    it helps by taking a look at the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap
        documentation</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/752741/screenshots/7811493/media/4fdbbcfa585a2e75d083f721e5554918.gif"
        class="blogimg">
</div>
<p>Bootstrap is a library of UI components, content formats, forms, and other such layout tools. Many of its
    components require JavaScript plugins, so it's necessary that the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag be specified
    within
    the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Similarly to what we discussed in Week 2, Bootstrap also recommends following a
    template which meets development standards, includling the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags. Everything's coming full
    circle! We'll start by loading the Bootstrap CSS into our <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, before all other styling
    sheets:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <pre>&lt;link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
    integrity="sha384-F3w7mX95PdgyTmZZMECAngseQB83DfGTowi0iMjiWaeVhAn4FJkqJByhZMI3AhiU" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>By default, Bootstrap employs a grid system. As such, it offers three main types of containers, the
    default of which (<code>.container</code>) is responsive, with its max-width changing at each breakpoint. So rather
    than concernng ourselves with CSS styling for a container, Bootstrap does the work for us (given we have all the
    correct imports in place to use it):</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <pre>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Content here --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p> You'll notice that breakpoints are a big deal in Bootstrap. A breakpoint is essentially a designer-specified width
    that determines how responsive the layout is across device screens/viewport widths. These breakpoints can also be
    called <i>grid tiers</i>, ranging from extra small to extra extra large. This breakpoint sizing helps uphold
    consistency by way of scaling for common device/viewport dimensions. Columns are also available within Bootstrap and
    make use of the grid system, as its hierarchy system goes container &#8594; row &#8594; column &#8594; content. Both
    Bootstrap's grid and column layouts rely on a flexbox architecture.</p>

<p>One area of Bootstrap I have experience in is its form control options; by default, Bootstrap builds a form
    vertically, but there are also horizontal and inline form layouts. Bootstrap's global styling for forms means
    that most form labels and controls should be wrapped in <code>&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;</code> and that
    <code>.form-control</code> should be added to all input and selection items. In this example we are also using
    <code>class="mb-3"</code> to have a margin bottom (mb) on each element. Here's what the code would look like
    for a vertical form that asks for a username, password, and a checkbox if the user wants their credentials to be
    saved, as well as a login button:
</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <pre>
&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
        &lt;label for="userID" class="form-label">Username&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="username" class="form-control" id="userID" aria-describedby="userNameHelp"&gt;
        &lt;div id="userNamelHelp" class="form-text">Your Duke's email eID&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
        &lt;label for="userPW" class="form-label">Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="password" class="form-control" id="userPW"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="mb-3 form-check"&gt;
        &lt;input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="rememberUser"&gt;
        &lt;label class="form-check-label" for="remmeberUser">Remember me next time&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button type="login" class="btn btn-primary">Login&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>
</div>
<p>With the above code, what we get should look something like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="BootstrapLogin.jpg" class="blogimg"
        style="border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">
</div>
<p>How easy! No finnicky styling, or element alignment, just good ol' trusy Bootstrap. And there's so, so much more to
    it to explore! Too much more! This entire blog could be dedicated to the wonders of not
    having to fiddle as much with CSS, but we just don't have time for that. It's a shame we can't use Bootstrap for
    Project 1 but I guess that would just make things too easy, eh?</p>
