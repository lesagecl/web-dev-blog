<em>Media Queries &#8211 Friday,
    Sep. 17, 2021</em>
<p>Last week we talked about Search Engine Optimization, and one of the rules of optimization was having a site that is
    mobile-friendly. To achieve this we must use a responsive CSS technique called <i>Media Query</i>. During my
    research of this topic, two sources I consulted were <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">Mozilla's
        documentation</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp">W3 Schools</a>.
    <br><br>Media queries make it so that a webpage is adaptable for multiple screen dimensions, resolutions, and so on.
    As part of its syntax, the <i>media type</i> can optionally be defined to describe the type of device the code chunk
    is being made suitable for. This includes <code>all</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>screen</code>, and
    <code>speech</code>. Let's get into some code, shall we?
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://elements-cover-images-0.imgix.net/5503a40c-978d-4d7f-8fcf-413fbc3e5efe?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=1370&s=9e27da880a6fe2cf9fc5d512ff901383"
        class="blogimg">
</div>
<p>Media features always evaluate to either true or false. Below showcases how media features can have a range, min or
    max, which defines a minimum or maximum condition. For example:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <pre>
@media screen (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: red;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>This makes it so that when the user's browser window is less than 600 pixels, the background color changes to red.
    Notice that above uses the <code>screen</code> and <code>max-width</code> specifications. Multiple types and
    features can be specified following <code>@media</code> for particular cases in which the web page must be able to
    adapt to. </p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <pre>
@media only screen and (min-width: 475px) and (orientation: landscape) {
    &lt;!-- some code--&gt;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Above, any style specifications would be limited to a device with a screen, whose brower window is at least 475
    pixels and in the landscape orientation. One thing I learned from Chapter 7 of <a
        href="https://allover.twodee.org/responsive-web-design/media-query/">All Over the Web</a> which was not
    discussed in the aforementioned documentation is that within your CSS file, a media query must occur after a rule
    set, if not to be overwritten by the rule set. Thus it makes sense to declare most media queries at the bottom of
    the css file. One important philosophy introduced by this chapter of the text is that of the <i>mobile-first</i>
    development approach to web pages; I agree with the logic that a web page that works well on small screens probably
    works well on larger screens, and not the other way around.<br><br>
    Connecting this newfound knowledge to my <a href="090321.html">Week 1 blog</a> about the Chrome Developer Tools,
    it's important to note that it can be used to preview what the web page looks like at different screen layouts; the
    Toggle Device Toolbar widget allows you to preview the page on various devices, from iPhone to iPad, and even those
    that must not be named (*shudder* Android devices).<br><br>Much to think about while planning the creation of my
    next WebDev project! Till next time, toodeloo!</p>
